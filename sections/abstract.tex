There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom
setting, especially for instruction of computational tools and practices that
are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical
learning environments offer new ways for teaching students skills and concepts,
particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on
methods. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments offers an
attractive opportunity to improve the efficiency and easy with which students
can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using
commonly-available cloud computing services for improving the student experience
in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benefits (and challenges) with using a
server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the
technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions
for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy.
